## Styling

In the `site/example` folder you will see a file called `styles.scss`. This is a file very similar to a `css` file with some added benefits. To start using SCSS download this program called [Koala](http://koala-app.com/). Once installed open Koala and navigate to your page folder. In Koala you should see any SCSS files. You can use Koala to compile these files to CSS.
